        <p>
          On April 11, 1955, the name "Taekwon-Do" was officially adopted to describe the martial art 
          developed by General Choi Hong Hi. For 70 years, Taekwon-Do has grown from its origins in Korea 
          to become one of the world's most practiced martial arts, with millions of practitioners across 
          more than 150 countries.

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-primary text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The Birth of Taekwon-Do</h3>
        <p>
          General Choi Hong Hi combined elements of traditional Korean martial arts such as Taek Kyon with 
          influences from Karate, which he had studied while in Japan. His vision was to create a martial art 
          that would embody Korean culture and philosophy while being accessible to people worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The name "Taekwon-Do" itself holds deep meaning: "Tae" means to jump, kick, or strike with the foot; 
          "Kwon" means to punch or strike with the hand; and "Do" means art, way, or method. Together, they 
          form "the way of the hand and foot."
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-primary text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Growth and Global Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout its 70-year history, Taekwon-Do has evolved from a martial art focused on self-defense 
          to a multifaceted discipline that encompasses sport, fitness, mental discipline, and personal growth. 
          It became an Olympic sport in 2000, further cementing its place on the world stage.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          The International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF), founded by General Choi in 1966, has been instrumental 
          in spreading the art globally, establishing standards for instruction, competition, and advancement.
