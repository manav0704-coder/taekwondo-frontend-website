        <p>
          General Choi Hong Hi was born on November 9, 1918, in Hwa Dae, Myongchun District, in what is now North Korea. 
          During his youth, Korea was under Japanese occupation (1910-1945). As a frail boy, he began studying calligraphy 
          and a Korean form of hand fighting known as Taek Kyon to strengthen his body.

        <h3 className="text-primary text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Military Career</h3>
        <p>
          In 1937, Choi was sent to Japan to further his education. While there, he earned a 2nd degree black belt in Karate. 
          He was forced to serve in the Japanese army during World War II, but was implicated in a rebellion and imprisoned. 
          During his imprisonment, he continued to practice martial arts.

        <p className="mt-2">
          After Korea's liberation in 1945, Choi became a commissioned officer in the new South Korean Army. He quickly rose 
          through the ranks and was eventually promoted to general. During his military career, he began developing a martial 
          art that would eventually become known as Taekwon-Do.

        <h3 className="text-primary text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Birth of Taekwon-Do</h3>
        <p>
          General Choi combined elements of Taek Kyon and Karate to develop Taekwon-Do, which means "the way of the hand and foot." 
          The name "Taekwon-Do" was officially adopted on April 11, 1955. Gen. Choi developed 24 patterns (teul), each representing 
          24 hours in a day, symbolizing an entire lifetime.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          In 1959, Gen. Choi led a military demonstration team that introduced Taekwon-Do to the world. The martial art quickly 
          gained international recognition for its dynamic kicking techniques and emphasis on both physical and mental discipline.

        <h3 className="text-primary text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Founding the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF)</h3>
        <p>
          On March 22, 1966, General Choi established the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) in Seoul, South Korea. 
          Due to political differences with the South Korean government, he later relocated to Canada in the 1970s where he 
          continued to promote Taekwon-Do worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Throughout his life, General Choi traveled to more than 123 countries to personally teach Taekwon-Do and promote 
          its philosophy of building a more peaceful world. He authored 15 books on Taekwon-Do techniques and philosophy.
